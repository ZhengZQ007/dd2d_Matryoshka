This is a program to carry out dislocation dynamics simulations in two-\/dimensions.

A hierarchical data structure tree is created so that various entities in the simulations, such as dislocations, dislocation sources, slip planes, etc., can be managed efficiently. This program will also take advantage of the functionality provided by the C++ S\-T\-L to manage lists of various objects in the simulation.
