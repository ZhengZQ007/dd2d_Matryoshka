/**
\mainpage
This is a program to carry out dislocation dynamics simulations in two-dimensions.

A hierarchical data structure tree is created so that various entities in the simulations, such as dislocations, dislocation sources, slip planes, etc., can be managed efficiently. This program will also take advantage of the functionality provided by the C++ STL to manage lists of various objects in the simulation.

To view the hierarchical structure, go to the section labeled Data Structures > Class Heirarchy. A good place to start would be the Defect class, which is the generic base class for most of the entities present in the simulation.
