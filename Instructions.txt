This file describes how to use the code delivered in this folder. In order to obtain a more recent and up-to-date version, clone the git repository using the following command:
~/...<folder>$ git clone git@github.com:adhishm/dd2d_Matryoshka.git <project folder name>

The ownership of the repository may also be transferred to someone else. If this is the case, please replace the name 'adhishm' with the github username of the new owner.

Running the program:
The folder containing the executable should a parameters file. It should also have two folders called 'input' and 'output', or the names as provided in the parameters file.

The folder input contains the input files. The executable needs the name of the parameter file. For example you can run the executable with the following command:
~/.../executable$ ./dd2d_Matryoshka ./input/grain_parameters.txt
This will load the parameter file called grain_parameters.txt. This file specifies the material properties, simulation parameters and the grain structure file grain_3sp.txt. The grain structure file grain_3sp.txt specifies the positions of dislocations and other defects within the grain.
Similarly, if you want to run a simulation for a single slip system, you should use the file input/slipSystem_parameters.txt.
The structures of the input files is specified in the wiki (https://github.com/adhishm/dd2d_Matryoshka/wiki), also found in the folder documentation/wiki/.
