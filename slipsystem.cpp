 * @brief Definition of the SlipSystem class.
 * @details This file defines the Slipsystem class representing a slip system in the simulation. A slip system is considered to be a set of slip planes, all parallel to each other. The attributes of a slip system are the slip plane normal and the slip direction, both expressed in the frame of reference of the grain.
